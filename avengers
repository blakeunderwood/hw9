## Pramit
#### There’s a 2-in-3 chance that a member of the Avengers returned from their first stint in the afterlife, but only a 50 percent chance they recovered from a second or third death.
```{r}
# chance of returning after first death
yes_count <- table(av$Return1)["YES"]
no_count <- table(av$Return1)["NO"]
first_death_return_rate = yes_count / (yes_count + no_count)
first_death_return_rate

# chance of returning after second death
yes_count <- table(av$Return2)["YES"]
no_count <- table(av$Return2)["NO"]
second_death_return_rate = yes_count / (yes_count + no_count)
second_death_return_rate
```

## Blake
#### on 57 occasions the individual made a comeback.
```{r}
# total number of times avengers have returned
times_avengers_returned <-sum(av$Return1 == "YES") + 
                   sum(av$Return2 == "YES") +
                   sum(av$Return3 == "YES") +
                   sum(av$Return4 == "YES") +
                   sum(av$Return5 == "YES")
```

```{r}
library(dplyr)

av <- av %>%
  mutate(time = rowSums(across(starts_with("Death"), ~ ifelse(.x == "YES", 1, 0))),
         death = ifelse(time > 0, "YES", "No")) %>%
  select(-c(Death1, Death2, Death3, Death4, Death5, Return1, Return2, Return3, Return4, Return5))

## Emiliano
#### The MVP of the Earth-616 Marvel Universe Avengers has to be Jocasta — an android based on Janet van Dyne and built by Ultron — who has been destroyed five times and then recovered five times.
```{r}
# number of times Jocasta has died
av %>%
  filter(Name.Alias == "Jocasta") %>%
  select(time)
```

## Blake
#### I counted 89 total deaths — some unlucky Avengers.
```{r}
# total amount of avenger deaths
time_sum <- sum(av$time)
